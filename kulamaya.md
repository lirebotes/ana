# Kula Maya — Website & Digital Foundations Proposal

**Prepared by:** 6PT  
**For:** Kula Maya Boutique Hotel & Spa  

---

## 1. Goals & Approach

Kula Maya already has strong demand via OTAs and partners.  
The goal of this engagement is to:

- **Significantly grow direct bookings through kulamaya.com**, and  
- Do it in a way that **complements (not replaces)** your existing OTA channels.

We’ll focus on three pillars:

1. **A performance-first, custom website experience** that feels as premium and soulful as the property.
2. **Clearer booking journeys and messaging** that naturally steer guests toward booking direct.
3. **Smart measurement and light automation** so the website keeps improving over time.

We start with a **complimentary Digital Checkup**, then deliver a foundations build scoped to **USD $7,950**, with optional extras you can add now or later.

## 3. What’s Included in the $7,950 Foundations Package?

### 3.1 Digital Checkup (Complimentary)

Before we touch anything, we’ll run a **Digital Checkup**:

- Website & booking flows: where users get lost, what’s unclear, device issues.
- Search & visibility: how you appear for your own name and key location queries.
- Google presence: quick view of your maps/profile health.
- Baseline analytics: what’s currently tracked, where the blind spots are.

**Deliverable:** a short report with:

- “Where you are today” across the main digital touchpoints.  
- Top 3–5 **quick wins**.  
- A refined **phased roadmap** (which maps directly to this proposal).

This is a **real piece of work** (internally valued around $750) that we’re including at no charge as part of the engagement.

---

### 3.2 Website Experience & Performance Rebuild — $4,500

This is the heart of the project: a **custom, performance-first website** that matches the experience of being on property.

#### a) Clarify the story and value of booking direct

We’ll sharpen the messaging so that within a few seconds it’s crystal clear:

- What Kula Maya is and where it is.
- Who it’s for (wellness travelers, couples, retreat guests, locals looking for a spa day).
- Why booking direct through your website matters:
  - More flexibility.
  - Best access to offers.
  - Direct relationship with your team.

We’ll refine the content structure on key pages:

- Home
- Stay / Accommodations
- Spa & Wellness
- Outdoor Dining / Terrace
- Impact / Experiences
- Arrival / How to get here
- Policies & key FAQs

#### b) Design booking journeys that favour direct bookings

We’ll map and improve the core paths, including:

- Home → Stay → Book direct  
- Home → Spa → Contact/Book  
- Home → Experiences/Impact → Register/Enquire  

This includes:

- Clear, consistent **Book Now** calls-to-action.
- Key information visible when it actually matters (amenities, policies, transport).
- Better cross-linking between rooms ↔ spa ↔ experiences ↔ FAQs.

#### c) Performance-first rebuild on a modern stack

Right now, your pages are **very image-heavy** and use a content-rich theme, which is part of why mobile Lighthouse tests are coming back around **9 seconds** to load on slower connections.

We’ll rebuild the site on a **lightweight, modern stack** (e.g. Astro + static hosting), with:

- Optimized images (right sizes, modern formats where possible).
- Reduced JavaScript and third-party bloat.
- Fast global delivery via CDN.
- Clean HTML and CSS focused on your real content.

**Target:** bring typical mobile load times down to **under ~2 seconds** on a reasonable 4G connection. Even before any other marketing, this kind of performance jump tends to:

- Reduce drop-offs on mobile.
- Increase engagement with key sections (rooms, spa, booking).
- Raise click-through rates into the booking engine.

We’ll also:

- Run **before/after performance snapshots** (e.g. Lighthouse scores, key metrics).
- QA across **desktop, tablet and mobile**.

---

### 3.3 Analytics & Measurement Setup — $750

You want a **clearer picture of direct bookings** vs everything else, without having to become an analyst yourself.

We’ll:

- Set up or clean up **GA4** on kulamaya.com.
- Implement tracking for:
  - **Book Now** click-outs to your booking engine.
  - Contact form submissions.
  - Newsletter signups (if applicable).
- Mark the right events as **Conversions**.

We’ll configure simple dashboards and views that **we use as your digital partner** to:

- Monitor performance of key pages and funnels.
- Understand where direct booking paths are breaking.
- Feed into ongoing SEO / CRO / ads decisions.

You get:

- Access to the data if you want it, and  
- Clear, human summaries via email/meetings when we review performance (especially if you choose any ongoing monthly plan).

We **won’t** hand you a complex technical dashboard and expect you to learn analytics; instead, we manage the measurements and surface the important conclusions.

---

### 3.4 Initial SEO Setup (One-Time) — $900

We’ll set strong SEO basics so Kula Maya can:

- Own its **branded searches**, and  
- Show up more often for relevant location-based terms.

#### What we do:

- **Keyword & intent snapshot** (lightweight):
  - Branded: “Kula Maya”, “Kula Maya hotel/spa Atitlán”, etc.
  - Location/intent: “boutique hotel San Marcos La Laguna”, “spa hotel Lake Atitlán”, etc.
- **On-page improvements**:
  - Page titles & meta descriptions for core pages.
  - Clean H1/H2 structure for clarity and SEO.
  - Sensible internal linking between pages (e.g. stay → spa → impact → arrival).
- **Technical basics**:
  - Check sitemap and robots.
  - Fix a small set of clear issues (broken internal links, missing alt tags on key hero imagery, obvious canonical issues).

This initial work gives you a **clean baseline** we can build on with any ongoing SEO plan later.

---

### 3.5 Email/CRM Foundations + 2 Core Automations — $1,050

We’ll set up the minimal but **high-leverage** email infrastructure so your guest relationships don’t end at checkout.

#### a) ESP/CRM setup

- Standardize on a tool (Mailchimp, Brevo, ActiveCampaign, etc.).
- Create simple segments:
  - Direct guests.
  - OTA-origin guests (where data allows).
  - Website leads that haven’t booked yet.
- Define core fields (name, email, stay dates, origin, etc.).
- Connect website forms (contact / newsletter) to this system.

#### b) Two core automations (included)

1. **Pre-arrival info & upsell**
   - Sent a few days before arrival (timing based on what’s technically possible).
   - Includes:
     - Key arrival info and practical details.
     - Spa and wellness upsell (book your treatment in advance).
     - Experiences suggestions, impact offerings, and any current special events.

2. **Post-stay thank you & review request**
   - Sent shortly after checkout.
   - Includes:
     - Personalized thanks.
     - Links to preferred review platforms.
     - Optionally, a soft line about returning in the future.

We’ll design these so they feel **on-brand and human**, not like generic hotel templates.

---

### 3.6 Paid Ads Setup — $750

Once the website is performing well, it makes sense to **buy traffic where it counts**, especially for:

- Branded searches (protecting your name from being dominated by OTAs), and  
- Simple remarketing to people who have already visited your site.

We will:

- Set up or audit the ad accounts (Google / Meta).
- Install the necessary pixels/tags on the new site.
- Create 1–2 **small, focused campaigns**, such as:
  - Branded search: when someone types your name, they see your official site.
  - Lightweight remarketing: remind past visitors who didn’t book.
- Write ad copy and basic creatives.
- Launch and run an initial optimization loop (adjusting bids, keywords, etc.).

**Media spend** (the money that goes to Google/Facebook) is separate and paid directly by you; we’ll help you choose a sensible starting budget.

---

## 4. Recommended Phasing

To keep the project manageable and aligned with your budget:

1. **Phase 0 – Digital Checkup **
   - Short call + audit.
   - Deliver concise report and confirm priorities.

2. **Phase 1 – Foundations Build **  
   *(Everything in the $7,950 package)*  
   - Performance-first website rebuild.
   - Analytics & measurement setup.
   - Initial SEO setup.
   - Email/CRM foundations + 2 automations.
   - Paid Ads setup ready for launch.

3. **Phase 2 – Optional Enhancements (as desired)**
   - Extended guest lifecycle emails & re-engagement.
   - Retreat leader nurture flow.
   - CRO tests on key sections.
   - Google Business refresh.
   - Activation of ongoing monthly support (SEO, Ads, Care).

---

## 5. Assumptions & Out-of-Scope

**Assumptions**

- You’ll provide:
  - Access to the current website and hosting.
  - Access to the booking engine and any existing analytics where possible.
  - Existing brand assets (logo, fonts, photography) and sign-off on copy.
- OTAs remain an important distribution channel; we are:
  - **Improving the website** to compete better for direct bookings.
  - Not replacing your OTA strategy or changing your OTA contracts.

**Out-of-scope (can be added later if needed)**

- Deep, day-to-day OTA optimization (rate parity, OTA-specific content, promo setup).
- Full visual rebranding or logo design.
- Professional photo/video shoots (we’re happy to collaborate with your photographers).
- Custom PMS/booking engine build beyond what’s supported by your current tools.
- Extremely advanced multi-language SEO or content programs.
- Complex abandoned-cart setups in the booking engine (we can, however, design **retargeting and follow-up emails** around inquiries, past guests, and website behavior).

---

## 6. Next Steps

If this feels aligned with where you want to take kulamaya.com:

1. **Confirm the $7,950 foundations package** as the initial scope.  
2. Decide which, if any, **optional extras** you’d like to include right away.  
3. Schedule the **Digital Checkup call** so we can finalize priorities and timeline.  
4. Provide access (website, hosting, booking engine, analytics) so we can begin.

From there, we’ll focus on delivering a **fast, beautiful, conversion-ready website** that reflects the real Kula Maya experience and helps more guests choose to book direct.
