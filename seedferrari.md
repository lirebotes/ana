# The Seed — Menu Pricing & Plan

**Stack:** Astro (frontend) + Netlify (hosting/CDN) + **Sanity** (CMS for blog & pages, no Git required).

**Aesthetic:** earthy elegance; soulful, stylish, smooth interactions.

**Goal:** launch The Seed site first, then layer on funnel/ads. (We can hold off on ongoing SEO spend in 2025 and revisit later.)

## Case studies / references

- Boutique hospitality & retreat builds + lead-gen funnels of similar scope.
- 6pt.co

## Assumptions & out-of-scope (so we stay smooth)

**Assumptions**

- Final brand assets, copy, and proof read of EN/ES translations.
- Existing **Hospitable** and payment processor accounts available (I think I have these still).
- One custom design direction with two rounds of refinements on key templates.
- Bank accounts + corporate structure for payments. 



**Out-of-scope (can be added if needed)**

- Heavy copywriting, photo/video shoots, advanced multilingual SEO program, custom PMS flows beyond Hospitable embed/API, complex booking fee/tax logic, custom plugin development, PR/link-building.
- Third-party costs (CMS paid tiers, fonts, stock, ad spend) are client-side.

## Why start with the web build (and pause SEO monthly in 2025)

Your brand wins on **experience + aesthetics**. The fastest return right now is a **gorgeous, performant site** + a **tight funnel**  to prove demand and refine messaging. Monthly SEO is valuable, but it compounds over quarters; I suggest we **defer that spend** until the site + funnel data shows where organic will pay off most. We can always spin up SEO in 2026 with clearer content priorities.

## Next steps

1. 👍 Approve **Web build (The Seed) — \$4,900**
2. Pick optional add-ons to run in parallel or after launch (I suggest **Funnel** first, then **Paid Ads Setup**)
3. Share brand assets, copy, translations, Hospitable/Stripe access
